= Run Solace PubSub+ with Docker or Podman

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop] and https://podman-desktop.io/[Podman Desktop] can be used to run containers on you local computer. 
This is the easiest way to spin up an Event Broker instance and probably the first step to try the container based deployment.

[NOTE]
The `docker` and `podman` CLI commands in these examples are interchangeable depending on which container runtime you use.
